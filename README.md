# Clustering: Strategic New Fitness Centers in Los Angeles
---
The goal is to minimize travel for all Los Angeles residents in need of access to a local gym while promoting health across the city. The objective of this project is to determine optimal locations for a new gym or fitness center within Los Angeles. Specifically, the end result is to compile a list of Los Angeles neighborhoods that have no gyms or fitness centers within 3000 meters from their center points.

Data Methodology:

  1. Geocoding LA Neighborhoods
  2. Data Visualization: Mapping Los Angeles
  3. Exploring Neighborhood Venues With Foursquare API
  4. Clustering Neighborhoods by Gym & Fitness Center Data
 
Tools: numpy, pandas, json, geocoder, IPython, matplotlib, sklearn, and folium.
