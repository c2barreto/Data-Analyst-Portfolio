### Developing an Automobile Price Prediction Model

Utilizing a public automobile dataset for machine learning, the goal is to explore and formulate models that can best predict a fair but accurate price for automobiles based on features or characteristics they hold. This project has been broken down into multiple notebooks.

Data Methodology:

  + Data Wrangling: Automobile Data Set
  + Exploratory Analysis on Features that Impact Automobile Prices
  + Developing Models to Predict Automobile Prices
  + Automobile Price Prediction Model: Evaluation and Refinement

### Clustering: Strategic New Fitness Centers in Los Angeles

The goal is to minimize travel for all Los Angeles residents in need of access to a local gym while promoting health across the city. The objective of this project is to determine optimal locations for a new gym or fitness center within Los Angeles. Specifically, the end result is to compile a list of Los Angeles neighborhoods that have no gyms or fitness centers within 3000 meters from their center points.

Data Methodology:

  1. Geocoding LA Neighborhoods
  2. Data Visualization: Mapping Los Angeles
  3. Exploring Neighborhood Venues With Foursquare API
  4. Clustering Neighborhoods by Gym & Fitness Center Data
