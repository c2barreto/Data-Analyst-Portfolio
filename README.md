# Data Analyst Portfolio

---
This repository is a portfolio of data science projects I've completed for self learning and under the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program on Coursera. The projects are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

# Commulative Projects: Data Analysis with Python 
---
### [Clustering: Strategic New Fitness Centers in Los Angeles](https://github.com/c2barreto/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Data-Analysis-Projects/Strategic-New-Fitness-Centers-LA/Capstone-Opening-More-Fitness-Centers-LA.ipynb)

The overall goal is to minimize travel for all Los Angeles residents in need of access to a local gym while promoting health across the city. The objective of this project in particular is to determine optimal locations for a new gym or fitness center within Los Angeles. Specifically, the end result is to compile a list of Los Angeles neighborhoods that have no gyms or fitness centers within 3000 meters from their center points.

Data Methodology:
  + Data Gathering
  + Geocoding LA Neighborhoods
  + Data Visualization: Mapping Los Angeles
  + Exploring Neighborhood Venues With Foursquare API
  + Clustering Neighborhoods by Gym & Fitness Center Data

### [Machine Learning: Modeling Loan Classifiers](https://github.com/c2barreto/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Data-Analysis-Projects/Modeling-Loan-Classifiers/Modeling-Loan-Classifiers.ipynb)

The project goal is to build an accurate model that can predict whether loans from customers will be paid off or sent to collections. Several loan classifier models are to be built using machine learning on a dataset about past loans. The best classification model will be selected after each model's accuracy is evaluated.

Data Methodology:

  + Preprocessing & Data Exploration
  + Classification Models
    + K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
    + Decision Tree
    + Support Vector Machine
    + Logistic Regression
  + Model Evaluation Using Test Set
    + Preprocessing Test Set for Evaluation
    + Testing Each Model

### Developing an Automobile Price Prediction Model

Utilizing a public automobile dataset for machine learning, the goal is to explore and formulate models that can best predict a fair but accurate price for automobiles based on features or characteristics they hold. This project has been broken down into multiple notebooks.

Data Methodology:

  + [Data Wrangling: Automobile Data Set](https://github.com/c2barreto/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Data-Analysis-Projects/Automobile-Price-Prediction-Model/1-Data-Wrangling.ipynb)

### [Movie Recommender System: Content Based Filtering](https://github.com/c2barreto/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine-Learning-Projects/Movie-Recommender-Systems/12-RecSys-Content-Based-movies.ipynb)

Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous, and can  be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. Content-Based or Item-Item recommendation systems, attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects. In this case, the goal is to figure out the input's favorite genres from the movies and ratings given.

### [Movie Reccomender System: User-User Filtering](https://github.com/c2barreto/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine-Learning-Projects/Movie-Recommender-Systems/13-RecSys-User-Filtering-movies.ipynb) 
  
User-User Filtering, is also known as Collaborative Filtering. This technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are several methods of finding similar users and the one that will be used here is going to be based on the Pearson Correlation Function.
